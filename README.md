# GitHub Analytics Project
Codebase for GitHub Analytics Project developed by Misha Ward

## Project Idea/Business Value
### Problem Statement
With the expansion of the technology industry over the past few decades, the importance of hiring a qualified developer has never been more important. Due to the demand of seeking highly skilled developers, the demand for recruiters has also risen with many being hired with limited technology experience. The _GitHub Analytics Project_ is designed to help recruiters by providing them a tool to easily see if the candidate matches the experience the company is looking for by analyzing the candidate's GitHub account.

This project will utilize a public dataset containing the repository and commit data of GitHub users. Processing the data with industry standard tools such as Spark, AWS Cloud Computing Platform tools, and PostegSQL, will help show the recruiters the candidates’ skills with summary statistics.

### Business Use Cases
For this project explicitly, the main business use case would be for employers, specifically recruiters. Recruiters could use this website to quickly use the candidate’s GitHub link on their resume and then be able to toggle company standards for that role in order to see how the candidate ranks amongst others on GitHub.

In addition to recruiters using this tool, managers could use this tool for incoming employees in order to understand their strengths and weaknesses and know where they might need more guidance.

Finally, college admissions might find use for this tool as it would help with determining if candidates have enough skills in order to be able to complete coursework in highly technical fields.
